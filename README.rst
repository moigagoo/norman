**Norman** is a migration manager for `Norm ORM <https://moigagoo.github.io/norm/norm.html>`__.

Norman provides a CLI tool to manage migrations and a ``normanpkg/sugar`` module used in migrations.

Quickstart
==========

1.  Install Norman with `Nimble <https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble>`_:

.. code-block::

    $ nimble install norman

2.  Add Norman to your .nimble file:

.. code-block:: nim

    requires "norman"

**Note:** Norman requires the development version of Nim.


Usage
=====

1.  Go to your Nimble package directory and run ``norman init``:

.. code-block::

    $ cd myapp
    $ norman init
    Created models file, models directory, config file, and migrations directory:
            src/myapp/models.nim
            src/myapp/models
            config.nims
            migrations

-   ``models.nim`` is the models entrypoint module. Import it in your app whenever you need to access the DB.

    You can either keep all your models in this file under ``db`` macro, or distrubute them across ``models/*`` submodules and aggregate them with ``dbFromTypes``.

    Initially, a placeholder model ModelÂ is defined in it to demonstrate how you can define your actual models.

    You can set ``normanBaseDir`` in your ``.nimble`` file to use a different root directory for your ``models.nim`` file and ``models/*`` submodules.

-   ``models`` is the models submodules directory. Initially, it's empty.
-   ``config.nim`` is the project config file. Use it to set the DB backend and credentials across your project.

    By default, it's set to use ``sqlite`` and ``database.db``.

-   ``migrations`` is the directory where your project migrations are stored. Initially empty.

2.  Generate your first migration with ``norman generate``:

.. code-block::

    $ norman generate -m "init db"
    Created migration directory, model backup, and migration template:
            migrations/1583931473_init_db
            migrations/1583931473_init_db/models.nim
            migrations/1583931473_init_db/models
            migrations/1583931473_init_db/migration.nim

In Norman terms, migration is a directory inside ``migrations`` that contains three things:

-   the desired models state
-   the code to get there
-   the code to undo those changes

The model state is stored the same way it's stored in your app: as ``models.nim`` and ``models``.

The migration code is stored in a file called ``migration.nim``, in ``migrate`` and ``undo`` blocks.

Migration names are prefixed with creation timestamps to ensure sequential application.

3.  Edit the new migration and add the actual code to apply and undo it. For the first migration, you probably want something like this:

.. code-block:: nim

    import normanpkg/sugar

    importBackend()


    migrate:
      import models

      withDb:
        transaction:
          createTables(force=true)


    undo:
      import models

      withDb:
        transaction:
          dropTables()

4.  Apply the migrations from ``migrations`` directory with ``norman migrate``:

.. code-block::

    $ norman migrate
    Compiled migrations: 1/1.
    Applied migrations:
            1583931473_init_db

5.  To undo a migration, run ``norman undo``:

.. code-block::

    $ norman undo
    Compiled migrations: 1/1.
    Undone migrations:
            1583931473_init_db

6.  Whenever you modify your models, go to 2.

For full usage, run ``norman help``:

.. code-block::

    This is a multiple-dispatch command.  Top-level --help/--help-syntax
    is also available.  Usage is like:
        norman {SUBCMD} [subcommand-opts & args]
    where subcommand syntaxes are as follows:

      init [optional-params]
        Init model structure.
      Options(opt-arg sep :|=|spc):
          -h, --help         print this cligen-erated help
          --help-syntax      advanced: prepend,plurals,..

      generate [required&optional-params]
        Generate a migration from the current model state.
      Options(opt-arg sep :|=|spc):
          -h, --help                         print this cligen-erated help
          --help-syntax                      advanced: prepend,plurals,..
          -m=, --message=  string  REQUIRED  set message

      migrate [optional-params]
        Apply migrations.
      Options(opt-arg sep :|=|spc):
          -h, --help                  print this cligen-erated help
          --help-syntax               advanced: prepend,plurals,..
          -v, --verbose  bool  false  set verbose

      undo [optional-params]
        Undo ``n``or all migrations.
      Options(opt-arg sep :|=|spc):
          -h, --help                  print this cligen-erated help
          --help-syntax               advanced: prepend,plurals,..
          -n=, --n=      int   1      set n
          -a, --all      bool  false  set all
          -v, --verbose  bool  false  set verbose
